# Project: Build a Portfolio Site
Project 2 for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
Open index.html to view a Portfolio of my Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Projects. 

PS: Instead of adding some fancy elements, I prefer to make the web page as close to the original mockup as possible, for respecting the designer (Jane Doette?).
